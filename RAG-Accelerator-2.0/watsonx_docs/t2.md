# Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Overview
Large Language Models (LLMs) are neural network-based systems trained on massive text corpora.  
They learn statistical patterns in language and can generate human-like text, answer questions, summarize content, translate languages, and more.

## Key Characteristics
- **Model Type:** Transformer-based architecture
- **Training Data:** Books, articles, web data, and curated datasets
- **Capabilities:**
  - Natural language understanding
  - Text generation
  - Code generation
  - Reasoning and analysis
  - Conversational dialogue handling

## Limitations
- May generate incorrect or fabricated information (**hallucinations**)
- Lacks true understanding or consciousness
- Knowledge may be limited by training cutoff
- Can reflect biases present in training data

## Applications
- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- Educational tools and tutoring
- Content generation and editing
- Customer support automation
- Programming assistance
